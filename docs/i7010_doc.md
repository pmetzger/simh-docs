# 1. Introduction

The IBM 1410 and 7010 were designed as enhancements to the IBM 1401, these were somewhat source compatible, but not binary compatible. The 1410 was introduced on September, 12 1960 and the 7010 in 1962. The 1410 was withdrawn on March 30, 1970. The 7010 featured 4 I/O channels where the 1410 had 2. Also the 7010 could access 100,000 characters of memory as opposed to the 80,000 for the 1410. The 7010 also featured optional decimal floating point instructions. Memory was divided into fields separated by a special flag called a word mark. Instructions end at the first character with the word mark set. They consist of a operation code, followed by 1 or 2 5-digit addresses, and an optional instruction modifier. If the 10's and 100's digit have zone bits set the address is modified by the contents of the five characters at locations 25-100. Each register is 5 characters long and word marks are ignored. The 1410 and 7010 could also be optionally equipped with priority mode to allow for device complete interrupts.

The 7010 or 1410 CPU has no registers. All operations on done from memory.

| SET CPU HISTORY=n  | enable history, length = n           |
| SHOW CPU HISTORY   | print CPU history                    |
| SHOW CPU HISTORY=n | print first n entries of CPU history |

The history trace shows the Instruction counter, the AAR and BAR before and after the instruction executed. The result of the instruction is displayed followed by the symbolic instruction.

### 3.2 I/O Channels (CH1..CH4)

The 7010 supported 4 channels.

|                   |                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| SET CHAN UREC=dev | Sets device to cause interrupts on a channel. |

Channels have the following registers:

| ***Name*** | ***Size(digits)*** | ***Comments***       |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| ADDR       | 5                  | Channel Data Address |
| CMD        | 1                  | Channel Command.     |
| FLAGS      | 32 (binary)        | Channel Flags        |

For meaning of bits in FLAGS see i7000_defs.h.

## 3.3 Unit record devices.

### 3.3.1 Inquiry Station (INQ)

The inquiry station allows for communications with the operating system. The station is half duplex and will either print or accept input. Whenever the computer sends a message it is prefixed with a ‘R’ character. When the station is ready to receive input it prompts with a ‘I’. Input is buffered until the return character is entered. Backspace will remove the last character typed. An \<esc\> will send an interrupt to the processor to request it read a record from the console. An \<esc\> while in input mode will cancel input mode and clear any typed message.

### 3.3.2 1402 Card Reader (CDR)

The card reader (CDR) reads data from a disk file. Cards are simulated as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card reader files can either be text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters per column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

|                          |                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SET CDR*n* FORMAT=TEXT   | Sets ASCII text mode                |
| SET CDR*n* FORMAT=BINARY | Sets for binary card images.        |
| SET CDR*n* FORMAT=BCD    | Sets for BCD records.               |
| SET CDR*n* FORMAT=CBN    | Sets for column binary BCD records. |
| SET CDR*n* FORMAT=AUTO   | Automatically determines format.    |

or in the ATTACH command:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| ATTACH CDR*n* *\<file\>* | Attaches a file |
| ATTACH CDR*n* -f *\<format\> \<file\>* | Attaches a file with the given format. |
| ATTACH CDR*n* -s \<*file*\> | Added file onto current cards to read. |
| ATTACH CDR*n* -e \<*file\>* | After file is read in, the reader will receive and end of file flag. |

The channel can be changed by the following command:

|                     |                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| SET CDR*n* CHAN=*c* | Set this device to channel *c*. |

The default assignments are:

|      |           |
|------|-----------|
| CDR0 | Channel 1 |
| CDR1 | Disabled  |

The card reader can be booted with the:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 66%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>BOOT CDR<em>n</em></td>
<td><p>Reads first card into address 1.</p>
<p>Starts execution at location 1.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached report error and stop

end of file out of cards

OS I/O error report error and stop

### 3.3.2 1402 Card Punch (CDP)

The card reader (CDP) writes data to a disk file. Cards are simulated as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card punch files can either be text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters per column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

|                          |                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SET CDP*n* FORMAT=TEXT   | Sets ASCII text mode                |
| SET CDP*n* FORMAT=BINARY | Sets for binary card images.        |
| SET CDP*n* FORMAT=BCD    | Sets for BCD records.               |
| SET CDP*n* FORMAT=CBN    | Sets for column binary BCD records. |
| SET CDP*n* FORMAT=AUTO   | Automatically determines format.    |

or in the ATTACH command:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| ATTACH CDP*n \<file\>* | Attaches a file |
| ATTACH CDP*n* -f *\<format\> \<file\>* | Attaches a file with the given format. |

The channel can be changed by the following command:

error processed as

not attached report error and stop

OS I/O error report error and stop

### 3.3.4 Stack Device (STKR)

The stacker device can be enabled, and files can be attached to individual bins of the stacker. The file format follows that of the CDP device. The individual unit reflects the stacker code sent by the computer. If no file is attached the output will go to the file attached to the CDP device.

### 3.3.5 1403 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LP) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with terminating newlines. Currently set to handle standard signals to control paper advance.

|  |  |
|----|----|
| SET LP*n* NO/ECHO | Sets echoing to console of line-printer output. |
| SET LP*n* CHAN=n | sets channel for this device |

### 3.5.2 7750 Communications Controller (COM and COML)

The 7750 is modeled as a terminal multiplexer with 33 lines. It consists of two device: COM is the multiplexer controller, and COML is the individual lines. For the first 32 lines, the 7750 performs input and output through Telnet sessions connected via a user-specified listening port; the 33rd line is permanently attached to the simulator console window. The ATTACH command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

|                     |                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| ATTACH COM \<port\> | set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being used other TCP/IP activities.

Each line (each unit of COML) can be set to one of twp modes: KSR-35 and KSR-37. In KSR-35 mode, lower case input and output characters are converted automatically to upper case, and parity is ignored. In KSR-37 mode, lower case characters are left alone, and even parity is generated on input. KSR-37 is the default.

Once COM is attached and the simulator is running, the 7750 listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming connection is a Telnet connections. The connections remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET COM DISCONNECT command,or a DETACH COM command.

|                        |                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| SET COM DISCONNECT=*n* | Disconnect line *n*             |
| SET COM CHAN=*n*       | Set channel for com controller. |

The 7750 implements the following special SHOW commands

|                      |                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SHOW COM CONNECTIONS | Displays current connections to the 7750   |
| SHOW COM STATISTICS  | Displays statistics for active connections |

The 7750 implements the following special SET commands:

|                          |                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| SET COML*n* LOG=filename | Log output of line n to filename   |
| SET COML*n* NOLOG        | Disable logging and close log file |
| SET COML*n* KSR35        | Set line *n* to ksr-35             |
| SET COML*n* KSR37        | Set line *n* to ksr-37             |
| SET COML*n* 2741         | Set line *n* to 2741               |

The controller (COM) implements these registers:

|        |        |                               |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------|
| *Name* | *Size* | *Comments*                    |
| ENABLE | 1      | Enable flag                   |
| STATE  | 6      | Controller state              |
| MSGNUM | 12     | Input message sequence number |

# 4 Symbolic Display and Input

The IBM 7010 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT commands:

|     |                                     |
|-----|-------------------------------------|
| -m  | Display/Enter Symbolic Machine Code |
| -c  | Display/Enter BCD Characters        |
| -n  | Display 1401 Symbolic Machine Code  |
|     | Display/Enter Octal Characters      |

The symbolic input/display supports several formats for instruction display:

- \<opcode\>

- \<opcode\> \<character\>

- \<opcode\> \<character\>\<character\>\<character\>

- \<opcode\> \<address\>

- \<opcode\> \<address\>,\<address\>

- \<opcode\> \<address\>,\<character\>

- \<opcode\> \<address\>,\<address\>,\<character\>

An address is a decimal number optionally followed by a +Xnn specifying an index register.
